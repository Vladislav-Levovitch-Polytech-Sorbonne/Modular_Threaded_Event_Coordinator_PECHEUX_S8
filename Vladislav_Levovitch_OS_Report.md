 # üìú Technical Report - Networked Reactive System with FSM Control

## Introduction

This project explores the implementation of a distributed architecture using **low-level system** tools. While based on the game logic of *Sherlock 13*, its primary aim is not to reproduce game mechanics, but to **demonstrate and validate core system-level concepts**. Through the development of a networked server-client structure, we put into practice notions such as **sockets**, **multi-threading**, **mutex synchronization**, and **finite-state machines (FSMs)**.

The game setting serves as a *pedagogical vehicle* : it provides context for structured interactions that trigger transitions, **thread activities**, and message **broadcasts**. The server reacts according to an internal FSM, and the system ensures synchronization through mutex-protected shared resources, enabling us to study concurrency and communication under real-world constraints.

## System Architecture Overview

The system is composed of a **central server** and **four clients** connected over TCP. The server maintains a **FSM** that controls its behavior during the connection phase and throughout interaction cycles. Each client communicates with the server via a socket, sending structured messages and receiving game state updates in return.

The server uses multiple **POSIX threads** to handle each client independently, ensuring responsiveness and isolation of blocking I/O operations. A **mutex lock** protects shared resources such as the list of connected clients or the current state of the FSM.

## General Communication Architecture

### ![Figure 1 - General Communication Architecture](./Useful_Resources/Images_ReadME/figure1_comm_architecture.jpg)

This diagram illustrates the core structure of communication between components. At the center is the **main server**, responsible for maintaining the FSM and dispatching state updates. Four clients - Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Donald - connect to the server. Each client is associated with a **local mini-server**, a passive listener designed to handle incoming messages from the server asynchronously.

The green dotted arrows symbolize **state broadcasts** or multi-client responses triggered by the server after processing a message. Red solid arrows represent **client-initiated actions**, such as connection requests or interaction commands. The "thread" and "cookies" notes refer to the server's multithreading logic and internal session/state management, respectively.

### üßµ Multithreading and State Tracking (**"Cookies"**)

The mention of *"cookies"* in this context is metaphorical. Just like web servers use cookies to **remember a user‚Äôs session** across multiple HTTP requests, our central server internally maintains **persistent information about each client** across different interactions. These include the client's :
- `Name`, Unique identifier (`ID`), Assigned `cards` or `objects`, `Connection status` and `Turn progression` 

This is crucial in a multithreaded architecture where the server spawns a **dedicated thread for each connected client**. Without this internal tracking (akin to a **cookie mechanism**), the server wouldn't be able to __personalize responses__ or __keep consistency in shared state__.

For instance, when a client receives a message such as :
- `D 1 3 5` - the server is distributing specific items (like cards) to that client.
- `V 1 1 1` - the server replies that client 1 holds object 1 exactly once.
- `M 1` - the server tells everyone that it‚Äôs client 1‚Äôs turn.

These messages are tailored to each client's internal session data. This ‚Äúcookie-like‚Äù memory is what enables the system to behave coherently and synchronously, even under concurrent execution with threads.

### üîå Socket-Based Micro-Servers and Communication Model

Every client connects to the server through a **dedicated socket**, and from a design point of view, the main server can be imagined as **hosting four mini-servers internally** - one per active client. Each socket is paired with a thread, ensuring that all clients can communicate independently and simultaneously.

Once connected, a client has a persistent communication channel with the server :
- The server uses `send()` to **push messages** to a specific client.
- It can **broadcast** updates by writing to all sockets (e.g., when informing everyone of a new turn).
- Each thread reads from its socket using `recv()`, allowing real-time reactions to client actions.

This architecture allows the server to function like a **parallel dispatcher**, where each socket acts like a port to a virtual micro-service. These sockets and threads, combined with internal session tracking (the ‚Äúcookies‚Äù), give the system robustness and flexibility for managing interactive, real-time multi-user logic.

## Sequence Diagram : Connection Flow

### ![Figure 2 - Connection and Initialization Sequence](./Useful_Resources/Images_ReadME/figure_2_sequence_connection.jpg)

This sequence diagram presents a detailed view of the initial connection phase and illustrates how the server responds to each new client. Below is a simplified version of the interaction timeline :


1. **Client Charlie** sends `C localhost 32003 Charlie` :
   - Server responds with `I 0\n`,
   - Sends `L Charlie - - - \n` to Charlie.

2. **Client Alice** sends `C localhost 32001 Alice`. The server responds with :
   - `I 1\n` (client ID),
   - `L Charlie Alice - - \n` to both Charlie and Alice.

3. **Client Bob** sends : `C localhost 32002 Bob`. The server sends :
   - `I 2\n` to Bob,
   - `L Charlie Alice Bob - \n` to Bob, Alice and Charlie.

4. **Client Donald** sends : `C localhost 32004 Donald` :
   - Responds with `I 3\n`,
   - Broadcasts `L Charlie Alice Bob Donald \n`. to all clients.

The key takeaway is how **each new client triggers a full-state update**, sent to **all previously connected clients**, ensuring that every client holds the most recent global state.

This diagram also highlights **threaded event management** : for each connection, the server spawns or delegates to a **thread, locks a mutex** during state modification, and triggers appropriate responses via a shared communication buffer.

## Future Applications and Perspectives

Beyond the educational context and game-like framing, this project demonstrates the skeleton of a **real-time, concurrent client-server model**, highly applicable to modern systems. In **IoT infrastructures**, a centralized server coordinating sensor data streams from multiple devices could employ this same model. Clients (sensors) report data, and the server responds or broadcasts state changes across the network - all handled through thread-safe queues, FSMs for state validation, and asynchronous notification mechanisms. With adaptations, this could serve as a **base for smart home systems**, **monitoring platforms**, or **data aggregation pipelines** in distributed control systems.

Another relevant application lies in the realm of **collaborative tools** or **real-time multiplayer engines**, where many clients interact through actions that must be validated, sequenced, and rebroadcast. The FSM structure guarantees deterministic responses, while socket communication ensures scalability. By abstracting away the game-specific protocol and focusing on the architecture, this system becomes a potential **foundation for chat servers**, **interactive learning platforms**, or even **networked industrial control**. Its modularity makes it extendable with authentication, database logging, or persistent sessions using techniques such as forking processes or using named pipes for IPC.
